# Null Value Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript function handling of null values. The `foo` function in `bug.js` doesn't explicitly handle null values leading to potential issues. The solution in `bugSolution.js` provides a more robust implementation.

## Bug

The `foo` function fails to handle null input properly.

## Solution

The improved version includes explicit null checks, preventing unexpected behavior.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the original function with the bug.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to view the corrected function.
4. Run both files and compare results with different inputs.
